# SyDOM
Sophisticated Scalper Bot for BitMEX using orders imbalance analysis

The idea behind this script is to spot micro-extremes (to the upside or the downside) and anticipate the reversal. To achieve that, it uses a modelisation of the market behaviour for the last 3 days (autogenerated) and applies a RSI computation onto the delta between the buyers and the sellers for the last 14 periods (each modification of the orderbook is counted as 1 period). As another filter, we use regular Bollinger Bands applied on an 1-minute timeframe to avoid being caught in a defavorable jump. It works at the tick level and is best suited for ranging-type price action.

------------------------------------

Configuration

Just replace the key and secret fields with yours and adjust the number of contracts traded in sydom.py

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

------------------------------------

Execution

`python sydom.py`

During the first run, the script will automatically generate a model (if missing) based on the 3 previous days of price action. This model is retrained every day at 6:00 AM UTC. Basically, you don't have anything to do once the bot is launched...

This is what you get at the end of each model generation. It helps to check if the model_thr setting value is optimum. You have to look for a level where the spikes are about to reverse. Generally, 0.05 for ETHUSD is fine... This value is in ABSOLUTE terms !
